	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedAdeptusMechanicus" value="As the last Magos of the Adeptus Mechanicus falls, their troops lose focus and are easily cut down. Looking at the Skitarii corpses, you cannot but feel sad—these were loyal Imperial soldiers, like you, led by their faith to death at the hands of their peers, when foul Xenos and heretics still threaten the Imperium. Such a waste."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedLeaguesOfVotann" value="The troops of the traitor Astra Militarum are scattered and leaderless—without the firm command of their heretical leaders, the war is over. Now we must focus our efforts on securing Gladius Prime for the Imperium."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedChaosSpaceMarines" value="The heretics are… dead? From lasgun fire and true grit! The Astra Militarum army celebrates long into the night. In the morning, the Commissar reminds them of the fate of those who are exposed to infectious disease or heresy…"/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedEldar" value="However many million years of civilisation and learning and here they lie, all that learning lost, dead in the dust of an alien world. It was foul xenos learning anyway, so the better that we took them out of the universe."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedNecrons" value="The green light fades from the last artificial eye, as the last Necron gives up the fight. After immeasurable aeons of war, their cities are crushed, their troops atomised, and their leaders slain. Though beneath the planet's surface, millions more still slumber in deathly unquiet, let's call this a victory."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedOrks" value="The Greenskin menace has been defeated. Though that is not to say that it has been eliminated. Even though every Ork, Grot and Snotling is dead, their corpses are already spreading the spores that will raise a new army of Greenskins in a generation. With lasgun, flamer and battle cannon we will be waiting for them."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedSpaceMarines" value="The fabled Adeptus Astartes, the legendary warriors of the Imperium, lie dead to a man. No apothecary remains to gather their geneseed for the next generation, no mission from distant Terra can rescue them. The defence of Gladius Prime falls to you—though even if you succeed, the Inquisition will have questions to ask about what happened to the Space Marine Chapter station here…"/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedTau" value="They sought to corrupt you, the pathetic xenogens, but they couldn’t persuade a single guardsman. Your machines shall grind their skulls to bonemeal for your fields, melt their machines back to ore—all for the good of mankind."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDefeatedTyranids" value="With the death of the last synapse creature, the Tyranids have turned from a horrifying army of synchronised killing, into feral animals. Like the Catachan Devils, these animals are still vicious and deadly, but without co-ordination, they pose no long-term threat to mankind."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredAdeptusMechanicus" value="Tech-Priests, here? Rumours had circulated about the Cult Mechanicus’ secret projects, far out in the ash wastes, and Kastelans have been roving the surface since the Ork invasion—but still to see their mechanically-distorted forms through an omniscope is a surprise. More so when you come under fire from them…"/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredLeaguesOfVotann" value="You've encountered another group of Imperial Guard, equipped and trained much like your own men. However, they do not respond to your comms and immediately behave in a hostile manner. No matter whether they are traitors, heretics or Xenos pawns, they must be wiped from the face of Gladius."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredChaosSpaceMarines" value="Heretics! The Guardsmen quail in horror. To see these fallen humans isn't only to know that the Emperor was fallible, that his Space Marines could fail—but also to know there is no way that the Imperium will allow the Guardmen to walk away from this. At best, mind-wiping awaits the Astra Militarum, at worst, mass euthanasia."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredEldar" value="The fey Aeldari meddle even here, on an Imperial Hive World? They are weak and they are effete and they should have stayed to die of old age on their Craftworld. But if they must come, we will help them die here instead."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredNecrons" value="Necrons, here, on an Imperial world? Who knows how long have they been sleeping beneath the surface, making their inscrutable plans? Your only hope is to overcome them before they wake their sleeping millions and they make this planet theirs once again."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredOrks" value="Meeting Orks is almost a relief for a Guardsman—after all, their behaviour is minutely detailed in The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer and most veterans will have encountered and fought them before. The men that survived generally report that Orks are unhealthily interested in where their next fight is coming from—if you can avoid conflict with them, they will actually weaken over time."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredSpaceMarines" value="The greatest warriors the galaxy has ever known, the Space Marines are committed to rooting out the enemies of mankind wherever they may be, even amongst their allies. This Chapter won't even answer your comms—sadly you must assume that they consider you heretics or traitors, and prepare for war."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredTau" value="If the insidious whispers of heresy weren’t enough, here are xenogen who promise something more than glory and servitude in the name of the Emperor. We have a simple solution to their problem—double the ammunition allocation for each commissar."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannDiscoveredTyranids" value="Through the experiments of Tech-Priests Genetors, the ravening swarm has come to Gladius Prime. But without support from their Hive-Ships, they are not the overwhelming force they have been elsewhere. Perhaps here, Guardsmen alone will be enough to defeat them."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannFlavor" value="<style name='Italic'/>“Though our tanks and artillery are mighty, it is the vast ranks of Imperial Guardsmen that shall trample the enemy to dust—let them come.”<br/>  — Ursarkar E. Creed, Lord Castellan of Cadia<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>The Astra Militarum, commonly known as the Imperial Guard, is the primary fighting force of the Imperium of Man. Across a galaxy of a hundred billion stars, there must be billions of Guardsmen at least—yet even the Departmento Munitorum on Terra, which oversees this immense force, has no real idea of how many troops there are at any one time. A safe estimate is to say that there are millions of regiments.<br/><br/>What the Imperial Guard lack in strength, courage and resilience, they make up in numbers, organisation and fighting vehicles—the Guard's wide range of tanks is rightly feared. The manpower of the Astra Militarum is predominantly human, though they do employ stable mutant strains, such as the giant Bullgryns. All these troops are equipped with the best mass-produced weaponry that the Techpriest war manufactories can provide, though it is often backward compared to that wielded by their enemies.<br/><br/>Across the vastness of galactic space, the vast majority of the Imperium's battles involve the Astra Militarum. It is by their actions and endless sacrifice that mankind has claimed and held its place in the universe."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannLostFlavor" value="Deep beneath the Estate Imperium, amidst the city-like bureaucracy that is Terra's Administratum. Here an ancient Servo-skull inches above cluttered, dust-caked shelves, casting light for a shuffling scribe. The scribe finds the archive he is looking for and extracts an ancient dataslate. With a stroke of his stylus he puts a line through Gladius Prime. He pauses for a moment and, in a shaky hand, annotates the entry.<br/><br/>“Gladius Prime: main planet of the Gladius System, Segmentum Obscurus, Ixaniad Sector. Colony lost to warpstorms following the formation of the Cicatrix Maledictum, 999.M41. May the Emperor have mercy on their souls.”"/>

	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannShortFlavor" value="Made up of innumerable billions of soldiers from a million different worlds, the Astra Militarum is, by sheer weight of numbers, the greatest army the galaxy has ever known. They hold nothing less than the survival of humanity in their hands."/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannWonEliminationFlavor" value="The colony has been saved—well, what remains of it. The few remaining Xenos are fleeing to the corners of the planet. Hunting them down should be well within your veterans' capabilities. Truly, you are a war leader to rival Macharius!<br/><br/>With the eventual clearing of the warpstorms, the planet will return to Imperial rule. Rogue Traders will arrive, its cities will be rebuilt, the skulking civilian population will be bolstered by colonists from nearby sectors. Within a generation, it will be a viable colony again, sending its Imperial tithe like any other. Within ten generations, it may be a rich world supplying its own regiment to the Imperium. Within a thousand, it may be a depleted hive world, rife with corruption and filth, a cramped, impoverished home for future humanity. All this, for the glory of mankind—and for the Emperor!"/>
	<entry name="LeaguesOfVotannWonQuestFlavor" value="You will never know why the Tech-priest betrayed you and the Imperium, what he was trying to achieve, and what function the artefact on his gun-ship truly served. But with his elimination and the dispersal of the warpstorms, communications have been restored.<br/><br/>Yet the planet's few surviving astropaths have astounding news, straight from Terra itself. Whilst the warp storms shielded your planet, the wider Empire has seen great upheaval. Cadia has fallen, the galaxy has been rent asunder by the warp, and Roboute Guilliman, foremost of the Emperor's Primarchs, has awoken from his ten thousand-year slumber.<br/><br/>Despite this, your army will not be joining Guilliman's crusades. Gladius Prime's unique artefacts and strategic location mean you have been permanently assigned here—to protect the planet and the explorators, come what may."/>
